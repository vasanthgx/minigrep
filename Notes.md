
## Diference between dbg!() and println!()

The `dbg!()` macro in Rust is a useful debugging tool that can be used to print the value of an expression, along with the file, line, and column where the macro was used.

The key differences between `dbg!()` and `println!()` are:

1. **Output Format**: `dbg!()` outputs the expression in a more structured format, including the file, line, and column information. This can be helpful when debugging complex code, as it provides more context about where the value is being printed from.

2. **Evaluation of Expressions**: `dbg!()` evaluates the expression passed to it and prints the resulting value, whereas `println!()` simply prints the string you provide.

In the provided code snippet:

```rust
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    dbg!(args);
}
```

The `dbg!()` macro is used to print the value of the `args` vector, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the program. This can be useful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to inspect the contents of the `args` vector without having to use a separate `println!()` statement.

The reason `println!()` was not used in this case is that the `dbg!()` macro provides more information about the context in which the expression is being evaluated, which can be helpful when debugging complex code. Additionally, `dbg!()` is often more concise and easier to use than constructing a separate `println!()` statement.

In summary, `dbg!()` is a powerful debugging tool in Rust that can be more informative and convenient to use than `println!()` in certain situations.
